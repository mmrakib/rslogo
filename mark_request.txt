======================================================

1) I managed to use a parser combinator library to 
implement the parser!

I decided to use the 'nom' package for this task.

I used all basic parsers that it implements and
combined them together to build my larger and more
complicated parser.

Using this library makes it so that adding new features
becomes as trivial as using the already existing parser
functions. You only have to write a `parse_FEATURE()`
function and add it to the `alt` parser that combines
more specific parsers together, such as `parse_statement`
or `parse_expression`.

2) I made my errors beautiful!

Beauty is, of course, in the eye of the beholder. And I
didn't quite get the time to use a dedicated error
printing package like 'ariadne'.

However, I used the 'colored' package to allow for
multiple different colors of my terminal text, and used
a custom error printing utility function to format it
in an understandable fashion.

Every error I have also prints a set of hints to help
the user diagnose the issue.

3) Unit testing

I have 80% unit testing coverage but only for the `parser`
module. I didn't find it useful to do unit testing for
say the `evaluator` or `turtle` modules.

All my tests pass, and each test utilizes multiple test
cases.



Thank you for looking through my assignment project!

You guys have been very helpful this term. :)
